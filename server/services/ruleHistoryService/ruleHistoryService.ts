  //    I.e., we want TS to check that each snake_cased-version of an incoming

  //    the returned object can't have any other PublicRuleVersion fields

  // imagine the user's interested in one field `name`; the version history
  // could be:
  //
  //   { name: 'xyz', version: date1, first_version: date1 }
  //   { name: 'xyz', version: date2, first_version: date1 } // something besides name changed; first_version still good.

  //   { name: 'xyz', version: date4, first_version: date1 } // whoops, can't use first version for this
  //
  // So, the final history needs `('xyz', date1), ('abc', date3), ('xyz', date4)`.
  // To do that, there are a lot of edge cases, but we basically identify the
  // moments that a version changes in a salient way (i.e., when the set of
  // salient fields differs between adjacent raw versions), and only track the
  // versions of those moments (setting other rows to have a null version).
  // Then, we discard the null-versioned rows.
